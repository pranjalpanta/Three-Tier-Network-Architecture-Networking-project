🚀 Sharing Three-Tier Enterprise Network Design Project
I’m excited to share the Three-Tier Enterprise Network Architecture I designed, which simulates a realistic large-scale enterprise environment. This topology integrates advanced routing, switching, and security configurations commonly used in modern organizations.

Core Services Implemented
My design includes the key network services required for enterprise-grade operations:
DNS Server
DHCP Server
NTP Server (Time Synchronization)
Syslog Server (Centralized Logging)
These services help maintain accurate timestamps, dynamic IP allocation, network monitoring, and smooth device communication across the topology.

Technologies & Protocols Configured
I implemented a wide range of routing, switching, and security protocols, including:
OSPF, BGP, and EIGRP
NAT / PAT
ACLs for secured traffic policies
VPN Tunneling
HSRP for default-gateway redundancy
STP/RSTP for loop prevention
Port Security & BPDU Guard
IP Snooping
VTP & VLAN segmentation
LLDP / CDP
EtherChannel for link aggregation
DTP & IP Helper

Design Structure
The three-tier model includes:
Core Layer – High-speed backbone routing
 Distribution Layer – Policy control, load balancing, inter-VLAN routing
 Access Layer – End-user connectivity with structured VLANs
The topology also includes a branch network, connected through secure routing paths, with OSPF area design and BGP interactions.

 Key Learnings
This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
Enterprise routing & multi-protocol design
 Layer 2 & Layer 3 switching
 Redundancy & high availability
 Network segmentation & access control
 Infrastructure planning & documentation

I’m excited to continue building more advanced network topologies as I grow in the networking and cybersecurity field.
